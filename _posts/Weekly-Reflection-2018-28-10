   This our class learned about categorical and quantitative data. Categorical data asks the question "which one?" , quantitative data asks the question "how many?". This wasn't that challenging since I have learned about quantative data before in math and science class. However, I did have trouble in this question that was asked if "the sort phone book by last name is considered quantative or categorical?". This was a bit challenging for me because a phone book has numbers but it is organized in alphabetical order by last name. we also learned about data tables the contract for shapes is ...
   shapes = table;name,corners,is-round,sample 
One thing that i went over this year that i did this year that i also did last year is that a number is not the same as a string meaning 42 is not the same as "42" like the example given. In addition, to this you need to combine only a string with a string or a number with a number because two different data types will not combine. overall the most challenging was remembering that spaces need to be put in between each number and the symbol.
