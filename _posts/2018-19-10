This week my class programed a function. As we opened pyret and saved the flag we made and turned it into a function as we placed it in github.I choose the flag of mexico because I am from mexico.Here is an image of my flag so far ![Flag](/images/Flag.png). A challenge for me was getting the regtangle a certain size but the trick is to play with the numbers. I learned how to program a function. I need to improve on speed I need to work faster and more efficiently in order to get more things done in class. I also need to improve more in organizing myself to work more on these assignments after School.
