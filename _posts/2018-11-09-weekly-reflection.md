  This week we learned about delivery states and created a contract named Next position that had an output of delivery state one challenge was getting the delivery box inside the house. Data definitions are abstractions of a table because they give us the information that is required for the tables. This week we also learned about designing functions and a designed we made was perimeter-to-area and the contract to this function was perimeter-to-area::(p:: Number)-> Number. One challenge was getting the contract to this function but once it was shown to us it was very simple for me to follow the contract because I find math interesting and this is what I enjoy doing in this class. One thing I can improve on is learning how to come up with a contract for a function because I know what to do after the contract it's just I don't know how to create a general statement for what is occurring in the function.
